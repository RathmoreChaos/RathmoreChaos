Hi all, I’ve decided to name this account @RathmoreChaos after the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_geological_features_on_Europa">geological feature</a>
on Jupiter's moon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon)">Europa</a>.  I mainly chose the
name because it sounds cool, and maybe a little ominous.  In case you're wondering if it has anything
to do with a video game called "Destiny", no it does not.

At least in the near term, I plan to use this space to host some Interactive Fiction projects I'm working on.
